### **constructor(data)**

Phones json-array is passed as a parameter `data`. If the parameter is missing, throws an exception `"phone data missing"`.

### **getTypes()**

For example

```json
["home", "work", "mobile"]
```

### **getPersonsNumbersByType(firstname,lastname,type)**

If no person with given name is found, an empty array is returned.
If no number with given type is found, an empty array is returned.
If at least one parameter is missing, an exception `"missing parameter"` is thrown.

For example the work numbers of Leila Hökki:

```json
["87654321", "05040302"]
```

### **getAllNumbersByType(type)**

Returns an array of objects consisting of names and numbers of given type.

If no number of given type is found, an empty array [] is returned.
If a person has multiple numbers of given type, each of them will be in its own object.

The format of the returned object is:

```json
[
  { "firstname": "", "lastname": "", "number": { "type": "", "tel": "" } },
  { "firstname": "", "lastname": "", "number": { "type": "", "tel": "" } }
]
```

```json
[
  {
    "firstname": "Leila",
    "lastname": "Hökki",
    "number": { "type": "work", "tel": "05040302" }
  },
  {
    "firstname": "Leila",
    "lastname": "Hökki",
    "number": { "type": "work", "tel": "87654321" }
  },
  {

  }
]
```

```json
{
  "firstname": "",
  "lastname": "",
  "phones": []
}
```

```json
{ "type": "", "number": "" }
```

If a person doesn't have a phone (the phones field is an empty array), then the person is not added into the result array.

If all phones are missing, an empty array is returned.

```json
{
  "firstname": "Matt",
  "lastname": "River"
}
```
